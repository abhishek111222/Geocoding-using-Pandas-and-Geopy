# Geocoding-using-Pandas-and-Geopy


Geocoding is the process of taking input text, such as an address or the name of a place, and returning a latitude/longitude location on the Earth's surface for that place. In this we are using "Geopy". 

Geopy is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services. Geopy makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources.

For using Geopy you need Internet connection and be aware that sometimes you can get TimeOut Error. In case this happens try to run your program again. It is mainly because of the slow Internet connection.
